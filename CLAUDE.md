# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the FLMintDeal project - appears to be a deals/commerce application based on the repository name. This is a fresh repository with no existing codebase yet.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen. Common setups include:

### For Node.js/JavaScript projects:
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linting
```

### For Python projects:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install dependencies
python -m pytest                   # Run tests
python -m flake8                   # Run linting
```

### For other frameworks:
Update this section once the technology stack is determined.

## Project Structure

This section will be updated once the codebase structure is established.

## Architecture Notes

This section will be populated as the application architecture is developed.

## Important Commands

This section will be updated with project-specific commands once the development environment is set up.
